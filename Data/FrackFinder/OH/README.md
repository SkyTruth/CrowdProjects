SkyTruth FrackFinder OH {TODO: Years} Methodology
=================================================


Permitting information can be downloaded in a computer readable delimited
format from the Oil and Gas division of the Ohio DNR:

Data was downloaded on `2014-06-20` and is currently located in the folowing
locations:

>       Source_Data/HorizontalWells_MonthlyUticaPagesize_05032014.pdf
>       Source_Data/Marcellus-061414.xls
>       Source_Data/Utica-061414.xls

The tables can likely be filtered down to wells marked as `Permitted` for
use in Tadpole.  Further research must be conducted in order to determine
whether or not these data are all horizontal wells.

Ohio's NAIP coverage is fairly good, but they also maintain a website where
imagery of varying resolutions (low and high) can be downloaded for any
given county.  This site is a good candidate for making imagery collection
and management a lot easier while allowing us to take advantage of some of
the available higher resolution imagery.
