The sweeper app was set up with a redundancy of 1, which means that when multiple
people are looking at tasks, at the same time, a single task could be completed
by multiple people.  The task_run.json file contains ONE task_run for every task
and the ORIG-task_run.json is the file as it was exported.  The first matching
task_run was kept and the rest were tossed.
