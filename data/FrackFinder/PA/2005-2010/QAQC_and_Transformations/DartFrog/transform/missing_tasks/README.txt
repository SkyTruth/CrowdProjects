The note below does not pertain to this dataset as it was processed AFTER the bug was fixed.



After the tasks and task runs were transformed into a shapefile AND all the sampling was complete, a bug was discovered that was populating the incorrect task.json 'id' into the 'id' column.  This bug was fixed and the data was reprocessed into stats.  The original data, from which the sample sets were pulled, lives in BAD-stats.
