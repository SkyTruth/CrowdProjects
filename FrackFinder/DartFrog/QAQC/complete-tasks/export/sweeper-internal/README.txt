The sweeper app was set up with a redundancy of 1, which means that when multiple people are looking at tasks, at the same time, a single task could be completed by multiple people.  The scrubbed_task_runs.json file contains ONE task_run for every task.  The first matching task_run was kept and the rest were tossed.
