== General Workflow ==

1) Downloaded all tasks into task-backup
2) Convert task.json/task_run.json to a shapefile with aggregated attributes via *frogname*-task2shp.py and put in task-backup
3) The random sample tool in QGIS has a bug causing it to ignore a layer’s filter - apply necessary queries and store in sample/query
4) Perform random sampling of 100 sites for public apps and 50 sites for internal apps on the saved queries
5) Manually QAQC each site accordingly



== Tadpole ==
Manually sample 100 random sites for each year to make sure the crowd’s response is sane.  Sites were compared in QGIS by loading the appropriate imagery and examining each task individually to determine the site’s classification

No queries needed - public crowd completed all tasks

2005 - 6 disagreements
2008 - 4 disagreements
2010 - 2 disagreements



== MooreFrog ==
Sample 100 random sites and test for the following for omitted ponds, which were ponds within the area of interest that were not clicked on.

No queries needed - public crowd completed all tasks

2005 - 18 omitted ponds - None appear to be fracking related
2008 - 19 omitted ponds - None appear to be fracking related
2010 - 6 omitted ponds - 2 appear to be fracking related



== DartFrog ==
Verify crowd’s pond classification by manually examining each sample site.  Samples taken across all apps across all years.

Public sampling query: “p_crd_a” >= 80 AND “n_tot_res” >= 10
Internal sampling query: “p_crd_a” >= 66

2005 First Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 2 pond classifications
2008 First Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 5 pond classifications
2010 First Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 4 pond classifications

2005 Final Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 0 pond classifications
2008 Final Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 0 pond classifications
2010 Final Internal - NO SAMPLE - All DartFrog 2010 tasks were completed by the public or the First Internal app

2005 Public - NO SAMPLE - All DartFrog 2005 tasks were completed in the internal applications
2008 Public - Sampled 99 - disagreed with 18 pond classifications (unsure why 99 sites were sampled and not 100)
2010 Public - Sampled 100 - disagreed with 10 pond classifications

2005 Sweeper Internal - Sampled all 6 sites - disagreed with 0 pond classifications
2008 Sweeper Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 6 pond classifications
2010 Sweeper Internal - Sampled 50 - disagreed with 6 pond classifications
