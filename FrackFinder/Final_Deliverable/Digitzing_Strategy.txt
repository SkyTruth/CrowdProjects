== NEED ==
Number of ponds from the DartFrog sampling that were re-classified as fracking
Add radius/area to app


== Digitizer ==
Public completed tasks where agreement >= 80 AND classification = fracking
Internal tasks with agreement < 100 OR classification is fracking




Distance analysis for tasks with high degree of certainty to determine a look radius for finding fracking ponds



Deliver final



1) Assemble final task list
2) Distance matrix for fracking points to clustered permits
3) Use distance to determine which classes classified as other
